# tamagotchi

This schoolproject was about coding SensorTag to work as a Tamagotchi. Project included deeper level C programming, where UART was used to read and write data. The project included sending data to back-end server and reading data from there. 

Basically the tamagotchi had three functionalities, eat, pet and exercise. Each of these functionalities were implemented using some buttons and sensors to identifiy each action and when for example petting the tamagotchi, we sent data to the back-end increasing that regarding "bar". Then again, if some of the bars were too low, the device gave warning sound to the user so that he could increase the low level bar. This way the tamagotchi won't die. 

I have only included the project main file and state machine diagram showing the basic functionality but I didn't include the sensor files which were given to us ready.
